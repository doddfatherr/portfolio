## Projects
### Novel Deep Learning Architecture to Monitor Upper Extremity Behavior
Journal paper in-progress, see [contribution 2](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/Thesis_ND2024.pdf) of thesis document.

Using Tensorflow/Keras libraries, developed novel BiDirectional Long-Short-Term (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze Electromyography(EMG) and classify human activity. Developed an in-home research procedure to collect data, segmentation and classification algorithm in **Python**, data processing pipeline using **MATLAB**, and model in _Google Colab_. Empirically determined optimal model hyperparameters to achieve a model F1-score of _84%_, comprable to many published works.
Compared model to other state-of-the-art models in EMG analysis, including convolutional neural-network (CNN)-LSTM, Transformer-LSTM hybrid models. 


### Predicting Grip Aperture using Forearm Muscle Activation Data
[Publication currently in press](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/IEEE_EMBC_Paper.pdf)

[Conference Poster]([https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/IEEE_EMBC_Paper.pdf](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/EMBC%20Poster_v1.pdf)) 
Designed and carried out data collection procedure on 10 participants to determine relationship between grip aperture (distance between thumb and forefinger) and forearm EMG. Developed novel computer vision algorithm to accurately capture aperture using _OpenCV_ grayscale, gaussian blur, and binary/adaptive thresholding techniques to track finger location. Performed descriptive statistics analysis in Rstudio. Work presented and published at IEEE Engineering in Medice Biology Society (EMBS) 46th annual conference
