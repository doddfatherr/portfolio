## Projects
### Novel Deep Learning Architecture to Monitor Upper Extremity Behavior
Journal paper in-progress, see [contribution 2](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/Thesis_ND2024.pdf) of thesis document.

Using Tensorflow/Keras libraries, developed novel BiDirectional Long-Short-Term (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze Electromyography(EMG) and classify human activity. Developed an in-home research procedure to collect data, segmentation and classification algorithm in **Python**, data processing pipeline using **MATLAB**, and model in _Google Colab_. Empirically determined optimal model hyperparameters to achieve a model F1-score of _84%_, comprable to many published works.
Compared model to other state-of-the-art models in EMG analysis, including convolutional neural-network (CNN)-LSTM, Transformer-LSTM hybrid models. 


### Predicting Grip Aperture using Forearm Muscle Activation Data
[Publication currently in press](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/IEEE_EMBC_Paper.pdf)

[Conference Poster]([https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/IEEE_EMBC_Paper.pdf](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/EMBC%20Poster_v1.pdf)) 


Designed and carried out data collection procedure on 10 participants to determine relationship between grip aperture (distance between thumb and forefinger) and forearm EMG. Developed novel computer vision algorithm to accurately capture aperture using _OpenCV_ grayscale, gaussian blur, and binary/adaptive thresholding techniques to track finger location. Performed descriptive statistics analysis in Rstudio. Work presented and published at IEEE Engineering in Medice Biology Society (EMBS) 46th annual conference

## Leadership and Activities
### Teaching Associate | California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo _September 2023 - June 2024_
- ME 251: Intro to Detailed Design, ME 129/130: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering 
Instructed 3 different mechanical engineering undergraduate 3 hour lab sections, each of 28+ students and 2 grading assistants. Taught SolidWorks principles to freshmen/sophomore throughout 10 week course, conveying topics such as engineering detailed drawings, hand drafting techniques, and GD&T fundamentals.  

### Journey of Hope Cyclist | The Ability Experience _June 2021 - August 2021_
Volunteered in fraternity national philantropy event where I cycled 3,663 miles from Santa Barbara, CA to Washington D.C to raise money and awareness for people with disabilites. Participated in "friendship visits" with 21 disability resource organizations across the country over 59 days. Personally fundraised $7000+ over 5 months leading up to trip departure. I was named local fraternity chapter brother of the year and an event team captain for training the most miles out of 20 cyclists.

### Surfboard Shaping Instructor | California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo _September 2021 - June 2024_
Facilitated a 6-week project-based course to handshape a surfboard from a polyurethane foam "blank." Instructed multiple classes of 6 students per quarter, ensuring each student's final product matches their specifications. Designed original surfboards from concept to schematic, prototype to final product with each student.
