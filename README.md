## Projects
### Novel Deep Learning Architecture to Monitor Upper Extremity Behavior
[Publication in Progress, see contribution 2 of thesis](https://github.com/doddfatherr/Thesis-2024/blob/main/Thesis_ND2024.pdf)

Using Tensorflow/Keras libraries, developed novel BiDirectional Long-Short-Term (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze Electromyography(EMG) and classify human activity. Developed an in-home research procedure to collect data, segmentation and classification algorithm in **Python**, data processing pipeline using **MATLAB**, and model in _Google Colab_. Empirically determined optimal model hyperparameters to achieve a model F1-score of _84%_, comprable to many published works.
Compared model to other state-of-the-art models in EMG analysis, including convolutional neural-network (CNN)-LSTM, Transformer-LSTM hybrid models.
